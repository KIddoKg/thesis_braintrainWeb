BrainTrain - A system to improve language skill for mild cognitive impairment patients.

Hello, my name is Nguyen Quoc Bao - ITITIU19081. This is my theis for International University.

The purpose of this study is providing the overview of technology selections which help Alzheimer’s patients improve language skill and diagnose those who run the risk of MCI throughout data from games. It is the first time games have been designed by Vietnamese, so that they easily approach to the elderly in Vietnam. In addition, patients’ conditions are followed by specialist doctors based on data from the games which will be stored on server and the website for doctors. Specialist doctor can give many types of exercises for each patient, and then send notification to reminder patients.

So, you need to download the flutter SDK firstly at https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install (this it all tutorial for mac, window adn linux ).And you should install Android Studio it's better if you run with a virtual machine because it provides you with an environment to create a virtual Android machine to run the application, if you have installed vs code then it's okay you can download the extension flutter and dart in vs code and run code with real android phone. Because, my application have api so it not run on web browser.

After install all requirement, open your terminal run:
```shell
flutter doctor
```
to check it work clearly. 

!!!Note recommend using Flutter version 3.19.5 and Dart 3.3.3
